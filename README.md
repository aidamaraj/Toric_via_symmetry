# Toric via symmetry
This repository hosts the codes and and necessary computational results supporting the upcoming paper titled _Symmetry Lie Algebras of Varieties and Applications_.

The implimentation of the key algorithm in the paper can be found in the file `Symmalg.sage`. Some examples of the how to use the code can be found in `Test_notebook.ipynb` and `Toricideal.ipynb`.
